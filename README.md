# TLE-Lite

A lite version of the very popular bot for Codeforces : [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE)

TLE-Lite is a lightweight-ripoff of [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE)

It was created because [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE) is kindof a pain to setup and host for people who are not very techy and used to inviting bots.
TLE-Lite is not as cool and orz as [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE), but it's easy to invite and can do most of the job.

Its currently in beta/testing, so it may act wierd sometimes
